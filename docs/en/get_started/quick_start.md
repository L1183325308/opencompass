# Get started quickly

We will take testing the performance of the chatglm2 model as an example to familiarize you with some basic functions of FinEval, which default to zero-shot and answer-only.

- Make sure FinEval is installed before running.
- Place the dataset under the fineval folder and name it data

- Download model weights, chatglm2-6b to the same directory as data
- The evaluation configuration file of fineval is based on the configuration.sh script, which is started by eval.sh.

If all is well, a prompt will appear on the screenï¼š
