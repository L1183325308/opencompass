# Parameter Configuration Description
```
--model_type model name
--model_path model path
--cot  Whether to use Chain-of-thought
--few_shot  Whether to use few-shot learning
--with_prompt  Whether to use the prompt template of alpaca, the default is not applicable
--ntrain The number of few-shot, if few-shot is False, this parameter is invalid
--constrained_decoding Whether to use the restricted decoding method, since the evaluation standard answer of fineval is ABCD, two answer schemes extracted from the model are provided: when constrained_decoding=True, calculate the probability that the first token generated by the model is ABCD, and select the probability The largest as an answer; when constrained_decoding=False, use a regular expression to extract the answer from the model-generated content.
--temperature Temperature for model decoding
--n_times Specify the number of repetitions of the evaluation, put the model under output_dir to generate a folder with the specified number of times, the default is 1, and the generated folder is toke0
--do_save_csv Whether to save the model generation results, extracted answers, etc. in the csv file
--do_test Test on the valid and test sets, when do_test=False, test on the valid set; when do_test=True, test on the test set
--gpus The number of gpus used in model testing
--only_cpu True Whether to use only cpu for evaluation
--output_dir Specify the output path of the evaluation results
